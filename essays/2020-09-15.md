Browser History 1
Without a doubt, I did not anticipate how hard the Workout of the Day (WODs) would be. From learning the necessary tags of “<a href=></a> to insert links for the table of contents to understand how to put an image and apply certain dimensions was a long journey! To start, I looked through the Web Page Basics readings on our class page to get a gist of what I needed to do. However, I did not understand most of the concepts the first time so I had to reread the text. Next, I tried to complete the tasks on my own but it was difficult since I was not aware of the text wrapping and persevere paragraph functions. As a result, my beginning attempt was in the Sd zone yet after seeing Professor Port’s screencast, I gained more information on how to correct my mistakes. For example, I learned how to link the section to the table of contents by using “<li><a href=”#”<a><li>” as well as adjust the image setting through “<img width=”100px” height=”100px” src=”_”>. Overall, my best attempt in BrowserHistory 1 after multiple tries was 13.66 minutes in the Rx zone. To see myself improve each time, I felt accomplished as I knew that I needed to ask certain spaces, commas, and hyperlinks. 


Advice
Don’t feel a burden because you couldn’t get it on the first couple of tries. You should keep trying and learn from each attempt to better yourself in doing the WODs. 

Browser History 2
For Browser History 2, I found it just as difficult since I had to work with another file along with the Index.HTML. While the instructions were short, I had to research the Google Fonts page to understand what I needed to do. It was helpful that the website provided a direct link to change the font from Tangerine to Oswald and Open Sans.  A common mistake that I made was forgetting to close my tags, which caused the words not to change colors or work on my web page when refreshed. On the other hand, I learned how to use “<link rel=” stylesheet” href=”style.css” to link both files and change the formatting through the body {_}. With this assignment, it took me less time and attempts to complete, which was 6 minutes.


Advice
Don’t forget the importance of closing the tags “< >” and “;” when adding more changes to the style.css file. 

Browser History 3
Lastly, Browser History 3 was challenging since it took me seven times to finish it. All concepts are new to me since I am not familiar with how to input a navigation bar and columns. As a hands-on learner, reading the material won’t stick until I continuously practice what I need to do. That said, I took more time when completing the assignment because I made the effort to write down what I did at each step. Altogether, I like the satisfaction I get from completing the WOD, and motivates me to keep trying no matter how difficult the work is. 

Advice
Watch out for the spacing and where you place tags. For example, start with “<div class= “left”>” and “</div>” at the end.
