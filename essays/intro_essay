title: Aspirations to be an MIS major
date: 2020-08-27
---
Aloha Everyone, my name is Justina Bui and I am pursuing a B.B.A in Finance, Human Resources, and Management Information Systems. As a daughter of immigrants, my parents are not tech-savvy, so it did force me to learn how to navigate the internet on my own. From scheduling appointments to fixing the Wi-Fi router, it has inspired me to want to further my knowledge in technology. Moreover, I decided to major in MIS because I participated in a STEM conference in high school. At the event, I was able to attend a game making workshop, where I learned how to use coding to make an online game. To see how a few functions can form characters, develop movements, and create a finished product was amazing. Lastly, at my former job, my work heavily relied on computer tasks and I constantly had to call the IT department to come to fix my technical issues. With their assistance, I admire how quick and well-versed they were in solving the issues at hand. I hope to become experienced and self-sufficient in working with technology and knowing how to fix it. Overall, I am excited to gain an understanding of coding and acquire skills in data systems.
