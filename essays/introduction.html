Aloha! My name is Jane Marielle Pagaragan and I am a B.B.A. Management Information Systems and Marketing candidate. Growing up as the youngest of four, my older siblings were my role models and greatest influences. At the time, social media platforms such as Myspace and Tumblr started to develop and grow in popularity. Although it wasn't that difficult, I was in awe watching my siblings do basic HTML coding to edit their social media pages and essentially piqued my interest in learning more about coding.

In high school, I was in a career pathway class that focused solely on softwares and IT. The class taught me how to program and code my own websites and how to use various softwares which I really enjoyed. By the end of the semester, I knew that computers and programming were of great interest to me. 

Prior to transferring to UH, I was an accounting major but decided that it wasn't for me. I knew that I still wanted to be a business major so my sister recommended that I majored in MIS at Shidler. She saw it as an opportunity for me to major in business while allowing me to have a career in the field that I am passionate about.
